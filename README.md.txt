Resume Screening using Machine Learning

Overview
In today's competitive job market, efficient recruitment processes are crucial for businesses to attract and retain top talent. Candidates apply in large numbers for jobs on web portals by uploading their resumes, due to the rapid growth of online-based recruitment systems. Finding the finest candidates for a position by examining hundreds of resumes requires a while and can introduce prejudice.

Traditionally, this process is performed manually, but companies often receive thousands of resumes for job applications so screening of these resumes is not only time-consuming but also very expensive for hiring companies. To reduce human involvement and errors, many new ways were introduced such as resume screening.

This project implements a Resume Screening system using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

It classifies resumes into job categories using:
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- One-vs-Rest classification
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning
- Label Encoding
- TF-IDF
- Train-Test Split
- Cross Validation
- Bias-Variance Analysis

Results
Random Forest and Decision Tree achieved 99% accuracy on the dataset.
